            <h2 class="section-title">6. Software</h2>

              other equipment. From time to time, Wiz may provide you with updates or modifications to Wiz Software. You understand that
              certain updates and modifications may be required in order to continue use the Wiz Software and Wiz Services.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">7. SPAM</h2>
            <p>
              Wiz enforces a zero-tolerance SPAM policy regarding information transmitted through our network. Wiz may determine in its sole
              discretion whether any transmissions are considered SPAM. SPAM includes, but is not limited to, the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bulk unsolicited e-mail, promotional material, or other forms of solicitation sent via e-mail that advertise any IP address
                belonging to Wiz or any URL (domain) that is hosted by Wiz.
              </li>

              <li>
                The use of web pages set up on ISPs that allow SPAM-ing (also known as "ghost sites") that directly or indirectly reference
                customers to domains or IP addresses hosted by Wiz.
              </li>
              <li>Forging or misrepresenting message headers, whether in whole or in part, to mask the true origin of the message.</li>
              <li>
                If Wiz determines that you have posted one or more articles of spam, we may cancel your account immediately and take steps
                to prevent you from using our network at any time thereafter.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">8. Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>
              Wiz may, with prior notice, change the fees it charges you for accessing the Services at any time. All prices are quoted for
              an unmetered number of devices. You agree that all fees charged by Wiz for accessing the Services will be automatically
              charged to your payment account on file with Wiz, at the time of any automatic renewal of your subscription for Services.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">9. REFUND POLICY</h2>
            <p>
              If you are less than 100% satisfied with the VPN service, we will gladly refund your payment if the refund is requested within
              the number of days listed on your signup offer (“Money Back Period”) after purchase. Requests made later than the Money Back
              Period will not be honored.
            </p>
            <p>
              You understand that certain cash equivalent or other payment methods may not allow for refunds or that refunds may happen
              slowly or by paper check or that refunds may have service fees associated with them. You agree and acknowledge that Wiz is not
              liable if a payment method does not allow for refunds. You will receive an offer for service in lieu of a refund if a payment
              method does not allow a refund.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">10. Use of Services</h2>
