              We believe everyone has the right to digital privacy. Along with digital privacy, consumers also have the right to
              transparency. Because you are entrusting us with your data, we believe it is even more important that we are transparent with
              you regarding <b>what</b> information we collect, <b>how</b> it is collected, from <b>where</b> it is collected, and
              <b>why</b> it is necessary to collect. We wrote this privacy policy with you in mind, attempting our best to provide a
              comprehensive yet easy to understand document.

            <b> The short version </b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Wiz VPN does not collect, monitor, or log your browsing activity, such as what websites you went on, when connected to the
                VPN Service.
              </li>
              <li>
                We collect aggregated and anonymous performance data to improve functionality and product performance, diagnose crashes,
                identify bugs, and optimize server performance. This aggregated and anonymous data does not include IP address, connection
                time stamps, or DNS inquiries.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our goal is to collect and retain the least amount of data. However we have to collect and retain some data, such as email
                address and billing information, which allows for you to continue using the VPN service.
              </li>
              <li>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.</li>
              <li>You have the right to request, review, and request deletion of your personal data.</li>

              sell personal information to third parties.

                physical security measures to protect the information we collect and maintain about you against unauthorized access and
                disclosure. However, because the internet is an open system, the transmission of information via the internet is not
                completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted using the internet.

            <p>
              When we process the data within our group, regardless of where we are, we have implemented appropriate safeguards to ensure
              your personal data will remain protected in accordance with European Union data protection laws. These safeguards include the
              Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers to our non-EEA entities. Where we use third parties which process your personal
              data internationally, we have implemented similar appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data will remain protected in
